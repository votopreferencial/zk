## Overview

The STVContract is a Solidity smart contract designed to implement a simple single transferable vote (STV) election mechanism. This contract facilitates a voting system allowing voters to rank candidates by preference and computes the winner when the quorum is met.

## Structure

### Data Structures

1. **Candidate Struct:**
   
   - `name`: A string representing the candidate's name.
   - `voteCount`: An integer representing the number of votes received, although not used in the current business logic.

2. **Voter Struct:**
   
   - `voted`: A boolean indicating if the voter has cast a vote.
   - `preferences`: An array of integers representing the voter's preferences, where each integer corresponds to a candidate indexed by their position in the candidates' array.

### State Variables

- **owner:** Stores the address of the contract deployer who acts as the contract administrator.
- **voters:** A mapping of address to `Voter`, storing whether each address has voted and their preferences.
- **candidates:** A dynamic array of `Candidate` structs.
- **quorum:** An integer indicating the minimum number of votes required before calculating the results.
- **totalVotes:** An integer that keeps track of the total number of votes submitted.

## Contract Functions

### Constructor

- **`constructor(string[] memory candidateNames, uint _quorum)`**:
  - Initializes the contract by setting the deployer as the owner.
  - Accepts an array of candidate names, initializing each candidate with zero votes.
  - Sets the required quorum.

### Modifiers

- **`onlyOwner`:** Restricts function execution to the contract's owner.

- **`hasNotVoted`:** Ensures a voter has not voted before allowing function execution.

### Voting Functionality

- **`vote(uint[] memory preferences)`:**
  - Allows voters to submit their ranked preferences.
  - Each voter provides an array of preferences corresponding to candidate indices, ensuring the array length matches the number of candidates.
  - Updates voter status and overall vote count.

### STV Tally Calculation

- **`calculateSTVTally() public view onlyOwner returns (string memory)`:**
  - Performs the calculation of the STV election results.
  - Verifies if the quorum has been reached before execution.
  - Initializes a tally for candidate preferences.
  - Iterates through voters and counts their first-choice preference.
  - Determines the candidate with the highest tally as the winner and returns their name.

## Best Practices

### Security Considerations

- **Authorization Control:** Use the `onlyOwner` and `hasNotVoted` modifiers to limit and control access to certain sensitive operations ensuring only authorized users can execute specific actions.
- **Parameter Validation:** Ensure input validation is present using require assertions to mitigate and catch incorrect usage and undesired outcomes.

### Improvements and Recommendations

- **Voting transparency:** While storing votes and calculating results off-chain would ensure increased scalability and privacy, ensure that all voter data is handled securely and transparently if stored on-chain or within a public context.
- **Gas Optimization:** Analyze and optimize storage patterns and loops to reduce high gas costs, especially within the `calculateSTVTally` function, which processes potentially large amounts of data.
- **Edge Cases:** Handle scenarios when no votes are cast or no suitable candidate exists to return sensible default outcomes.
